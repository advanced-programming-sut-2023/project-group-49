God wills it!
For the Holy Land!
Crusaders, forward!
Deus vult!
We march to glory!
Defend the faith!
Onward to Jerusalem!
With God's help, we'll prevail!
We fight for Christendom!
For the glory of God!
We march for Christ!
Onward, Christian soldiers!
The Cross our banner, the Faith our shield!
Death before dishonor!
Defend Jerusalem!
The Holy Land shall be ours!
By the grace of God, to victory!
For the honor of our king and country!
